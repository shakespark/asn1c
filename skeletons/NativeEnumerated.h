 * will do).
 * This type may be used when integer range is limited by subtype constraints.

/*
 * UPER forward compatibility: an extensible ENUMERATED value added by a
 * newer version of the type is carried on the wire (X.691 #14) only as its
 * extension index -- the true abstract value is unknowable to an older
 * decoder (X.680 #20.1 NOTE: enumeration values are ordered but not
 * necessarily contiguous). X.680 #6 forbids failing on such a value, yet a
 * plain long has no out-of-band way to flag "unknown". Following the reference tool
 * ASN.1 tool (this project's golden reference, which stores INT_MAX - index),
 * the UPER decoder stores the wire index enciphered as LONG_MAX - index, i.e.
 * in the reserved region [LONG_MAX - 65535, LONG_MAX].
 *
 * The literal 65535 is the widest index the PER runtime can transfer
 * (ASN_UPER_NSNNWN_MAX in per_support.h: uper_get_nsnnwn() reads at most a
 * 2-octet long form). It is repeated here rather than referenced because
 * this header is a self-contained application contract that also ships in
 * builds without per_support.h; a compile-time cross-check in
 * NativeEnumerated.c fails the build if the two constants ever drift apart.
 *
 * Contract for such a stored value:
 *   - The application MUST NOT interpret it as a meaningful enumeration
 *     value; it is only a placeholder for "unknown extension index N".
 *   - It may be relayed as-is: NativeEnumerated_encode_uper recognises the
 *     region and re-emits the identical index, so an unknown value received
 *     from one peer can be forwarded byte-for-byte to another, provided the
 *     SAME PER transfer syntax is used (X.680 #6/#7.1). The extension index
 *     is version-stable (X.680 #20.4 forces additions to ascend), so relay
 *     stays correct across schema versions.
 *   - Transcoding it to a different transfer syntax (DER/OER/XER) is
 *     meaningless -- those codecs carry the abstract value, not the index --
 *     and rightly fails (map miss) or, for codecs without a map check
 *     (DER/OER integer), emits this conspicuous near-LONG_MAX garbage rather
 *     than a plausible-looking enumeration value.
